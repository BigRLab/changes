This is a separate frontend (accessible via <your host>.com/v2/) that we're
building to replace the original one. Look in static/ and templates/ for the UI
currently being used.

Style notes:

- Times from the server should always be in UTC form, although they may not
  contain timezone info. By default, chrome and firefox will parse dates
  differently, so to be on the safe side you

- Don't use the abbreviated function as object attribute syntax, i.e.

  BAD:  {
          render() {
        }
  GOOD: {
          render: function() {
        }

  Makes it much easier to find functions in the file

- (TODO) variables should be camelCase, since the object spread syntax in display/ 
  components uses the same name for variables and object attributes, e.g.

  EX: var { data, headers, className, ...props} = this.props;

  Right now I mostly used under_scores :(. At least its easy to automatically fix

- (TODO) Add and enable ESLint
