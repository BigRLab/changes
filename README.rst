Changes
-------

Changes is a dashboard to view information about your code. Specifically, it focuses on aggregating quality metrics and history, such as results from a build server.

Supported build platforms include:

- `Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org>`_

.. note:: **Changes is under extremely active and rapid development, and you probably shouldn't use it unless you like broken software.**
